    <p>We invite researchers from academia and practitioners from industry to submit position papers. Papers should be 3–6 pages long (including references) in the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/#EAF" title="The Legacy CM CHI Extended Abstracts format">(Legacy) ACM CHI Extended Abstract template</a> (<a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/sigchi-chi20-sample-ea" title="Download the Word version of the CHI Extended Abstracts template">Word</a>/<a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/extended-abstract-source/" title="Download the LaTeX version of the CHI Extended Abstracts template">LaTeX</a>/<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/chi2020-extended-abstract/hvnyhtvgqhwc" title="Start an Overleaf project with the CHI Extended Abstracts template">Overleaf</a>).</p>

<p>The submission should describe the authors’ work related to the workshop aims and challenges below, or any other key topic that authors feel should be addressed by the community. Authors of position papers will be invited to present at the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-aims-and-challenges">Workshop aims and challenges</h2>

<p>In this workshop we aim to particularly focus issues that are particularly relevant for children and families around CUI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explore parameters and issues needing to be considered in designing CUIs for interpersonal spaces, such as people’s homes.</li>
  <li>Re-imagine CUIs as \textit{everyday computing interfaces.}</li>
  <li>Examine key ideas around the appropriateness and design of tool-like voice agents and social-actor like voice agents that might also support inter-person collaboration.</li>
  <li>Understand the challenges in designing inclusive CUIs that accommodate and are sensitive to one’s developmental stage, intersectional identity, and personal, social, and cultural context, specially in multi-party interactions in homes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there are specific and timely issues that we wish this workshop to raise, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What impact CUIs have on conversational habits, particularly those of children?</li>
  <li>How (if at all) personalities should be designed for personified CUIs? How should one ensure that such CUIs are not creepy?</li>
  <li>How can CUI (better) incorporate sociolects, i.e., non-standard dialects, such as Hinglish and African American Vernacular English.</li>
  <li>How can CUIs become a way for family members with low literacy or access to technology to interact with digital media and the Internet?</li>
  <li>How do parents and children organise and collaborate with and around these technologies?</li>
  <li>How can interactions with CUIs, as always-on, always-accessible technologies, be regulated by parents?</li>
  <li>How could we design these technologies to support education and e-learning? For example, how can CUIs appropriately support children’s in-home learning (e.g., by prompting reflecting instead of providing direct answers) while still keeping them engaged.</li>
  <li>How can parents and CUIs organise and collaborate in child rearing responsibilities? For example, what role can CUIs play to enhance or support children’s after-school activities, or the learning of appropriate manners and behaviours?</li>
  <li>How can we address existing CUI usability issues that limit accessibility to both general and underrepresented populations (pre-school children, children with mental or physical impairments, etc.)?</li>
  <li>How can CUIs support children by improving their mood and increasing positive emotions?</li>
  <li>How can CUIs enhance or support individual’s personal health and well-being?</li>
</ul>
