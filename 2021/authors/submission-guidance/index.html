The word limits are somewhat relaxed but note that papers which substantially exceed these limits may be rejected. Papers substantially under the word limit may not present a sufficient contribution for inclusion in the CUI proceedings. In summary, <strong>we ask authors to stick to the spirit of word limits.</strong></p> <h2 id="submission-process">Submission process</h2> <p>All submissions of original work (i.e. not the Featured Talks track) must be made by the conference submission system. Track chairs will assign three reviewers to each submission, and reviewers will anonymously review the submission. Each track has a difference emphasis that reviewers will be asked to consider. For example, submissions to the <a href="/2021/authors/full-papers" title="The CUI 2021 Full Papers track">Full Papers track</a> must demonstrate a novel contribution, submissions to the <a href="/2021/authors/provication-papers" title="The CUI 2021 Provication Papers track">Provocation Papers track</a> must have the capacity to spark a debate, and so on. Following the three reviews being submitted, the track chairs will make a decision whether to accept or reject the submission.</p> <p>This year we have introduced rebuttals for the <a href="/2021/authors/full-papers/" title="The CUI 2021 Full Papers track">Full Papers</a> track, allowing authors to respond to the reviewers before a final decision is made on submissions by the Full Papers Chairs. Rebuttals will be made through the conference submission system as a text-only response to the reviewers. Rebuttals can include promises to make changes to the paper, as well as to respond to points the authors disagree with. Reviewers will be given the opportunity to revise their review for this track, after which the Full Papers Chairs will make the final decision.</p> <p>At this point, all acceptances will be conditional on any changes requested by the track chairs being made to the paper. All tracks include a camera ready period where authors can make these very minor changes to their paper, in line with the reviews. Authors should make these requested changes and submit the revised paper to the conference submission system. Some papers may be “shepherded”, whereby the track chairs will work with authors to oversee changes to the paper requested if these are considered more than “very minor”. Papers may be rejected if it is felt authors have not made sufficient effort to revise their paper as expected.</p> <p>Following this process, authors will receive details from the Programme Chairs in how to get their paper ready for publication, including completing the rights review process.</p> <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2> <p>We ask all authors to prepare <strong>an accessible submission</strong> by marking up your documents with correct styles and features including tables and equations, setting text descriptions for all figures, not relying on colour to distinguish elements. The <a href="https://chi2021.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/guide-to-an-accessible-submission" title="Read the CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHI 2021 Guide to an Accessible Submission</a> should be followed as closely as possible, and provides useful guidance for doing this.</p> <p><strong>Papers will not be published if they do not adhere to these accessibility guidelines</strong>. Authors are expected to have ensured their paper is accessible by the camera ready deadline at the very latest. The publishing process takes some time and we have little opportunity to delay it. All papers must be readied before we can proceed with publication.
