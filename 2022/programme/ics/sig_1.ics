SUMMARY:CUI 2022: CUIs as Entertainers
DESCRIPTION:This SIG will feature practical demonstrations of tools that allow us to use CUIs as entertainers such as large language models like GPT-3, Hidden Markov Models like those used by Botnikâ€™s Voicebox keyboards, and the voice puppetry technology made by CereProc. This event will introduce these tools to participants and give everyone a chance to play around with them on their own, showcasing the creative and entertaining outputs they leverage from CUIs.Joining information has been emailed to registered attendees.\n\nChaired byJustin Edwards, Leigh Clark, Matthew Aylett, and Allison Perrone\n\nPlease see https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2022/programme/link/sig_1 for more detailed session information.
