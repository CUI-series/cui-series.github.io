SUMMARY:CUI 2022: Doctoral event
DESCRIPTION:This SIG will feature practical demonstrations of tools that allow us to use CUIs as entertainers such as large language models like GPT-3, Hidden Markov Models like those used by Botnikâ€™s Voicebox keyboards, and the voice puppetry technology made by CereProc. This event will introduce these tools to participants and give everyone a chance to play around with them on their own, showcasing the creative and entertaining outputs they leverage from CUIs.\n\nPlease see https://www.conversationaluserinterfaces.org/2022/programme/link/doctoral_1 for more detailed session information.\n\nJoining details are emailed to all registered attendees prior to the conference.
